    <h3 style="border: 1px solid black;">In a quiet village nestled between misty hills, there lived an old clockmaker named Elias. His shop was small and crammed with timepieces of every kind—grandfather clocks that ticked solemnly, pocket watches with faded initials, and cuckoo clocks that chirped in perfect unison. But the one clock no one ever saw was the one Elias kept hidden beneath a velvet cloth in the back room.

    Elias had no family, no apprentice, and rarely spoke to anyone except to hand over a fixed watch or take a repair order. But he had a secret. The hidden clock—ornate, with gold filigree and a face that shimmered like water—wasn't just a clock. It could turn back time.

    He had crafted it during his youth, a masterpiece powered not by gears alone but by a mysterious fragment of a fallen star he'd found in the woods as a boy. But Elias had learned early: changing the past comes with a price. He had once tried to save a woman he loved from a carriage accident, rewinding time by only minutes. She had survived… but someone else had taken her place beneath the wheels.

    Since then, the clock remained covered.</h3>
